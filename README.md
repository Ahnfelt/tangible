Description
===========

An experimental visual, functional programming language for touch screens

**Warning: the implementation has barely started, so the following documentation is a preliminary and incomplete.**

Example
=======

The lambda function `\a -> max a (sin a)` would be written as follows:

![Example program](/examples/example4.png?raw=true)

You can adjust each slider and immediately see how the result changes [1].

Instead of sliders, you could have widgets or other visualizations of values.

*TODO: Well, everything.*
